========

This is a library of templates used to create cloud components in the
OpDemand cloud management system.

See [github][1] for the latest source.

For more about OpDemand, visit [OpDemand][2].

Using Templates
---------------

OpDemand template files are in [YAML][3] format. A live template in the
OpDemand server is assembled from a *template*.yaml file (from under the
**/templates** directory) and from YAML documents referenced by that template
(in the **/modules** and **/components** directories).

The templates have been made open source by [OpDemand][2]. Please read the
**LICENSE** file for details. You are free to fork this repository, to submit
pull requests for improvements, or to add new templates. Thank you for
using OpDemand!
